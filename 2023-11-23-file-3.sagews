#Certainly, if you want to operate on a specific binary number, such as `11101100`, here's an example:

#```python
# Input
num = int("11101100", 2)  # Convert binary string to integer

# Operations
result = (num // 4 - 2) & 0b111111  # Divide by 4, minus 2, keep 6 bits, add % 2 bits 0-3
result = min(result, 15)  # Ensure the result is not more than 15
result = result - 15  # Subtract 15

# Limit to max 255
result = min(result, 255)

# Output
print(f"The result is {result}")
#```

#This code converts the binary string `"11101100"` to an integer and then performs the specified operations. The final result is printed after ensuring it doesn't exceed 255.
